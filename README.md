OverdriveGDX
============

OverdriveGDX is a total rewrite of the game FasterThanLight ([FTL](http://www.ftlgame.com/)), with modding in mind.

The new engine uses libGDX for graphics and BeanShell2 for scripting.

It's currently VERY early in development.


Requirements
------------
* Java (1.6 or higher).
    * http://www.java.com/en/download/
* FTL (1.01-1.03.3, Windows/OSX/Linux, Steam/GOG/Standalone).
    * http://www.ftlgame.com/
* WinXP SP1 can't run Java 1.7.
    * (1.7 was built with VisualStudio 2010, causing a DecodePointer error.)
    * To get 1.6, you may have to google "jdk-6u45-windows-i586.exe".

Android support might be added someday, as effort has been made to avoid incompatibility.
